# Little-Lemon-Capstone-Final
As part of the Meta iOS Developer class I was tasked with making a Swift application that lets a user see a menu with provided JSON data and select what they would like to order from the restaurant. 
This involved an understanding of UI/UX Design fundementals, a strong understanding of Swift fundementals, an understanding of the restaurants intended design and color identity, and JSON conversion principles.
